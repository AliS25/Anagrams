# Anagrams
Two words are anagrams if they contain precisely the same letters. 
A program, Anagrams.java, reads the words from a given text file and prints all sets of anagrams among the words in the file. 
The program also reports (1) the largest set of words that are all anagrams of each other, and (2) the amount of time taken to find the anagrams.
